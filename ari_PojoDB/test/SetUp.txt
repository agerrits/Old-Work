Instructions for deployment:
----------------------------

1. Configure MySQL to have a schema named 'solazyme' and ensure it has the permissions for the 'line_items' table as that is the one we have referred to in our sample. 

2.Put in the following script in active-bpel.xml that is located in <Designer7.0_Installation_Folder> designer\dropins\activevos\eclipse\plugins\org.activebpel.enginep_7.0\server\conf\Catalina\localhost folder:



<Resource name="jdbc/ariDB" 
             auth="Container" 
             type="javax.sql.DataSource" 
             username="root" 
             password="root" 
             driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver" 
             url="jdbc:mysql://localhost/solazyme"/>

This should be mentioned after the existing resource element and before the </Context> tag.

3. Start the embedded server in the designer and deploy the process through the pdd or by deploying the bpr under the deploy directory.

4. Retreive the 'OrderDetailsRequest' service wsdl from Catalog/Service definitions and send in a request to the service from a client such as Soap Ui or web service explorer (in designer)

5. Request could be given as one of the values you have stored in the 'purchase_order_id' column in the line_items table.
